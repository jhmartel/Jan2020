(Jan 11, 2020) Dear reader, since completing my PhD thesis (~Nov 2019, UofT), I have been consolidating and organizing various questions and problems which have arisen during my six years here in Toronto. An index of the subject matter is roughly as follows: 

1. Formalize the relationship between the repulsion costs c|Ï„ defined in my thesis (Ch.5) and Mach's Principle.

2. Extend Ahlfors' Laplacian formula for two-dimensional sectional curvature to determine the curvature properties of Hubbard's d-alpha metric, and complete the proof of Medial Axis Theorem as an application of homotopy methods of thesis (Ch.4).

3. Close the Steinberg symbol for the Mapping Class Group of closed hyperbolic surfaces.

4. Complete our treatment of probability interpretation of Einstein's GR gravitation equations.

5. Formalize and clarify Ralph Sansbury's text https://books.google.ca/books/about/Faster_Than_Light.html?id=0gK7MgEACAAJ&redir_esc=y

6. (More! Stay tuned).
